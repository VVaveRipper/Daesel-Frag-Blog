              <div class="post-date">May 29, 2025</div>
              <div class="post-content">
                <p>
                  Welcome to the official development blog for Daesel Frag! Here
                  I'll be sharing regular updates on my progress, design
                  decisions, and sneak peeks of what's to come with the game.
                </p>
                <p>
                  First of all, I would have to show some of the core aspects of
                  the game. To do this, I'll give a brief rundown of what the
                  game is about, the goal of the game and the inspiration behind
                  all of it.
                </p>
                <hr />
                <h5>
                  <li>
                    <u><b>What is Daesel Frag?</b></u>
                  </li>
                </h5>
                <br />
                <p>
                  Battle a horde of enemies in a round-based, hack-n-slash,
                  rogue-like style gameplay. The main playable character of the
                  game is Ryujin, but he isn't the only playable character
                  available. As you play the game more, you will notice that
                  there are several features that you can unlock after
                  completing several runs.
                </p>
                <h5>
                  <li>
                    <u><b>Goal of the game</b></u>
                  </li>
                </h5>
                <br />
                <p>
                  The goal of the game is to survive as long as you can until
                  you meet your inevitable demise (similar to CoD zombies).
                  After you've been defeated, your progress is reset to 0 and
                  you are sent back to the main hub world called The Silent's
                  Retreat. Inside of this hub world, you can allocate stat
                  points to grow stronger for your next playthroughs and
                  interact with stations that provide items through shopping and
                  upgrade gear. Rinse and repeat to unlock the best possible
                  stats for the character(s).
                </p>

                <p>
                  As you play, you will receive in-game EXP points to gain
                  special skills and abilities to help you during your
                  playthrough. As you progress through rounds, enemies get
                  tougher to beat. After every 10 rounds, a special boss enemy
                  will spawn (Subject to change). Once you've reached 100
                  rounds, the player is met with 3 choices: "Defeat a final boss
                  and receive legendary grade gear and double the EXP for your
                  current playthrough. (Very hard)" or "End the current
                  playthrough and receive the according EXP and materials" or
                  "Continue the playthrough in an endless mode."
                </p>
                <hr />
                <h5>
                  <li>
                    <u><b>Inspirations</b></u>
                  </li>
                </h5>
                <br />
                <p>
                  In this section of the blog, I'll be sharing some of the
                  main inspirations behind the development of the game.
                </p>
                <p>
                  One of the biggest inspirations for this game is the Legend of
                  heroes series, also known as the Trails series.
                </p>
                <figure>
                  <img src="assets/images/blog/img1.jpeg" alt="Character 1" />
                  <figcaption class="figcaption1">

                      Picture of the Legend of heroes protagonists.
                    </p>
                  </figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>
                  One of the reasons why I love the Trails series is because of
                  the various returning characters that you can meet throughout
                  the series. That aspect alone is something that I wanted to
                  implement in this game. It gives a sense of nostalgia to the
                  player when they see a familiar face from the previous games.
                </p>
                <p>

              <h3><u>Character Design Insights</u></h3>
              <div class="post-date">June 5, 2025</div>
              <div class="post-content">
                <p>
                  Today we're excited to share some insights into our character
                  design process for Daesel Frag! Our art team has been working
                  tirelessly to create characters that are not only visually
                  striking but also deeply connected to the game's lore.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Each character in Daesel Frag is designed with a unique
                  silhouette and color palette that makes them instantly
                  recognizable in the heat of battle. We've paid special
                  attention to their weapons and abilities, ensuring they feel
                  natural extensions of each character's personality and
                  background story.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We'll be revealing more characters in the coming weeks, so
                  stay tuned for more updates!
                </p>

              <h3><u>Combat System Preview</u></h3>
              <div class="post-date">June 12, 2025</div>
              <div class="post-content">
                <p>
                  This week, we're giving you a sneak peek at Daesel Frag's
                  combat system! Our goal has been to create a system that's
                  easy to pick up but offers depth for skilled players.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The combat in Daesel Frag focuses on fast-paced action with a
                  mix of light and heavy attacks, dodges, and special abilities
                  unique to each character. As players progress through rounds,
                  they'll unlock more powerful skills and combo opportunities.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We've implemented a dynamic difficulty scaling system that
                  ensures enemies remain challenging as players become more
                  powerful. This creates a satisfying progression curve that
                  rewards skill improvement without becoming frustratingly
                  difficult.

              <h3><u>Enemy Types Revealed</u></h3>
              <div class="post-date">June 20, 2025</div>
              <div class="post-content">
                <p>
                  Today we're pulling back the curtain on the various enemy
                  types you'll face in Daesel Frag! The game features a diverse
                  roster of opponents, each with unique behaviors and attack
                  patterns.
                </p>
                <p>
                  From nimble assassins that dart around the battlefield to
                  hulking brutes that can soak up massive damage, you'll need to
                  adapt your tactics based on the enemy composition in each
                  round. Some special enemies even have environmental abilities
                  that can drastically change the battlefield.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Boss enemies appear every 10 rounds and feature complex,
                  multi-phase encounters that will test your mastery of the
                  game's mechanics. Defeating these formidable foes rewards
                  players with rare gear and substantial experience points.

              <h4>Background</h4>
              <p>
                Born into a military family, Ryujin enlisted at 18 and quickly
                rose through the ranks due to his exceptional combat skills.
                After a classified mission went wrong, he was betrayed by his
                commanding officers and left for dead.
              </p>

              <h4>Abilities</h4>
              <p>
                Ryujin possesses enhanced reflexes and tactical awareness from
                experimental treatments. His signature weapons are dual plasma
                pistols that can combine into a more powerful rifle.
              </p>

              <h4>Personality</h4>
              <p>
                Despite his dark past, Ryujin maintains a strong sense of
                justice and loyalty to those he trusts. He's calculating in
                combat but can be reckless when pursuing personal vendettas.
              </p>

              <h4>Role in Story</h4>
              <p>
                As players progress through the game, they discover that
                Ryujin's quest for revenge unveils a larger conspiracy within
                the Daesel Frag tournament, forcing him to decide between
                personal vengeance and the greater good.

              <h4>Background</h4>
              <p>
                Raised in the digital underworld of New Shanghai, Nova was a
                child prodigy who hacked her first corporate database at age 12.
                After discovering evidence of dangerous AI technology being
                developed by the Daesel Corporation, she dedicated herself to
                exposing their activities.
              </p>

              <h4>Abilities</h4>
              <p>
                Nova deploys autonomous combat drones and uses a specialized
                neural interface to control multiple technological systems
                simultaneously. Her ultimate ability allows her to temporarily
                hijack enemy weapons and technology.
              </p>

              <h4>Personality</h4>
              <p>
                Confident and analytical, Nova approaches combat like a complex
                puzzle to be solved. She has a dry sense of humor and forms
                unexpected friendships with other competitors who share her
                suspicions about the tournament.
              </p>

              <h4>Role in Story</h4>
              <p>
                Nova's investigation into the Daesel Frag AI leads to
                discoveries about its true purpose, potentially setting her on a
                collision course with Axel as their separate quests intersect in
                unexpected ways.

              <h4>Background</h4>
              <p>
                The product of a classified super-soldier program, Magnus
                escaped his creators and has been living off the grid for years.
                The Daesel Frag tournament provides him both the challenge he
                craves and the resources to stay hidden from those who would
                recapture him.
              </p>

              <h4>Abilities</h4>
              <p>
                Magnus possesses superhuman strength, accelerated healing, and a
                specialized exoskeleton that amplifies his already formidable
                abilities. His signature weapon is a massive gravity hammer that
                can create devastating shockwaves.
              </p>

              <h4>Personality</h4>
              <p>
                Stoic and imposing, Magnus speaks little but observes
                everything. He follows a strict personal code of honor in combat
                and respects opponents who demonstrate skill and courage,
                regardless of their physical capabilities.

              <h4>Role in Story</h4>
              <p>
                As players advance through the tournament, Magnus transitions
                from intimidating final boss to potential ally, as his own
                investigation into the tournament organizers aligns with the
                protagonists' goals.
